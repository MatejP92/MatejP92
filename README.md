- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Matej Pal
- I am a junior software developer with a passion for problem-solving and creating innovative solutions. I have been learning and growing my skills in PHP, MySQL, and Python for the past six months, and I am excited to apply my knowledge to real-world projects. I am a quick learner and always eager to expand my skill set. You can find me on LinkedIn and Twitter to connect and see my progress as I continue to develop my abilities.
